## Topic
Analyzing the most popular video games to predict what type/genre video game will be popular in the upcoming months

## Reason Why
Ever since the pandemic hit, we personally have seen an increase of friends and family who have started playing video games. And it's very easy to access video games, since there are mobile games, pc games, and console games. 
With this in mind, we also strive to learn about what types of games can easily be played and profitable with the free to play option vs paid games and what types of genres might be popular in the future based on specific categories and genres they have.

## Description of the Data
We're using data from Steam, this data includes the game name, date released, user ratings, genre, price, and more. We will be including charts/graphs/tables to visualize our data. We will also be using this data as our base for our machine learning model. The goal of the machine learning model is to predict what genre will be popular in the upcoming months.

As a preliminary data preparation and exploration, Kaggle data from a Steam API call includes data for different types of games along with the amount of owners, ratings, price, whether the game is in English or not, categories for each games as well as genre types associated with each game. Other information included developer, platform, and publisher information.

A second source focused on sales for each game has been used to create a number of visualizations related to the success of sales across a variety of categories such as rank, name, publisher, developer, critic and user scores, as well as total shipped units, global sales and the year release of the game. 

## Questions we Hope to Answer
- Predicting what games will be popular in the season / time of the year.
- What types of games are successful?
- How can a person who is new to video games narrow their search to find a video game genre they will enjoy playing?
- How can free to play games be compared to paid games and how can that help users identify which games to play based on their budget?

## Upcoming Tasks
- Narrow down machine learning models that will help us answer our questions and compare them to optimize using best model. 
- Create visualizations that will help us answer our question as to what types of games are successful.
- Create a Javascript, HTML/CSS website that will help users filter game information by preferences.
